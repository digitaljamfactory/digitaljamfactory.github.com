I’m an experienced Agile Development Manager with strong people management skills built on clear communication and trust. These characteristics help me to achieve the best results for clients and stakeholders, bringing high quality projects to completion on time. I listen carefully then deliver exactly what I promise.

My background is in Java development for the telecoms industry, and I continue to develop my knowledge and skills. I particularly enjoy the challenge of picking up new systems and technologies quickly. Adapting to change also gives me the opportunity to put my solid project management experience to good use.

Outside of work I’m a massive rugby fan and, recently, a new Dad, so I am enjoying exciting change in my home life as well!
