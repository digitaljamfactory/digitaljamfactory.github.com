I've always wondered if MBA's are worth the money spent on them. I'm thinking about doing a part time masters this year so I picked up the "The 80 Minute MBA" to see what they are all about. It's a short read, the name gives it away but it is full of really useful information and has a great bibliography which I will use to further my own study but after reading the book I don't think I will be starting an MBA in the autumn.

One great piece of advice on leadership from the book is 

<blockquote>if you want someone to do a good job then give them a good job to do</blockquote>
