A trial is your opportunity to show what you can do. Be it an internal prototype, or a 30 day trial of a software product, someone is giving you the chance to prove what you can do so give it your full attention.

An example from the real world, I’m getting married in a few weeks and my fiancé booked a trial with the local hair stylist. On the day she was fobbed off with the apprentice, who did a very bad job. This wasn’t her fault she didn’t have the experience to do the job. When my fiancé complained that this wasn’t what she asked for and what would happen next, she had to wait an hour and half for the head stylist to come and speak to her. 

What did she say "it won’t be like this on the day". 

This morning my fiancé called to cancel her six appointments for the wedding. The owner asked "is there any we can do to fix this?" 

Too late you already had the chance to prove what you and your team could do and you blew it.

This is a good rule for life in general when presented with the chance to shine, make the most of it.
